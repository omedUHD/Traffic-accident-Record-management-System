# Traffic-accident-Record-management-System
The collection, management and dissemination of road traffic accident (RTA) related events has posed a serious problem to KRG road safety officers and all stakeholders alike. This is especiallytrue because of the absence of a central repository from which all accident related information canbe stored and managed. Where available, these information are available in paper based form and this poses a bottleneck in updating the available information. This project will be a Web based Road TrafficAccident Monitoring System (RTAMS) for road safety officers and all stakeholders alike
